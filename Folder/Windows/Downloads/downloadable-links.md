NOTE: Make sure it stays public but tell people in the description of the repo that it isn't for their us

NOTE: Don't include a readme, license, or gitignore.

3. upload the file (ex. welcome.pdf) and create a new release

4. delete the file from the repo

5. go to the release that you created

6. right click on the download button
